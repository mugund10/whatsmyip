## whatsmyip

A [simple HTTP server](https://aws.mugund10.top/ip) that echoes a client public IP address. This is utilized in my [Dynamic DNS (DDNS)](https://github.com/mugund10/dynamicdns) project to verify the current public IP and ensure accurate DNS updates.

## usage

```bash
$ curl https://aws.mugund10.top/ip
{"addr":"120.56.34.0"}
```
